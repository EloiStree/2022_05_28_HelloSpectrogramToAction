# Spectrogram To OMI  
This repository is a reminder that I want to code a spectrogram interface for Open Macro Input in aim to make action based on sound.  
   

Open Macro Input is a software compose of toolboxes to allows macro from large gamme of input.  
One that I would love to have is the ability to trigger action based on sound that I do with my mouth or object arround.  

The key to do tha tis Spectrogram:

Link with Job system and compute shader.  
(I suppose a AI expert would do it with neural network)   

Unfortunately, I don't have time to code it now.  
But it is strongly on my to do list.    

If you want to help me to work on this.   
Ping me to talk about it on discord:
